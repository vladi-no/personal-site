<!-- Company LLM / RAG assistants -->
<section>
    <div class="project-header">
        <h3>Company Knowledge Assistants (RAG-based LLM Systems)</h3>
        <div class="project-thumb">
            <img class="theme-light" src="{{ '/assets/img/portfolio/ollama.webp' | relative_url }}" alt="LLM assistant UI mockup light theme">

        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        For several companies in the Netherlands and the United States I designed and implemented
        “company LLMs” – internal assistants that understand their documentation, processes and
        historical data. These tools help teams find answers faster, draft content, and navigate
        complex internal knowledge bases without having to know exactly where things are stored.
    </p>
    <p>
        The systems use retrieval-augmented generation: relevant documents are retrieved from a
        vector index and passed to an LLM, so answers stay grounded in the company’s own data.
        Depending on the client, the model is either a hosted API (e.g. OpenAI / Anthropic) or a
        self-hosted open-source model such as Llama 3.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tech:</strong> Python (FastAPI/Flask), hosted and self-hosted LLMs (e.g. Llama 3 via
        vLLM / text-generation-inference), SentenceTransformers embeddings, vector databases
        (Qdrant, Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma), S3-compatible storage, Docker-based deployment, and
        simple React/Next.js front-ends with company SSO (OAuth/OIDC) for internal access.

<!-- Jira / Atlassian -->
<section>
    <div class="project-header">
        <h3>Jira Issue Assignment Intelligence – Atlassian</h3>
        <div class="project-thumb">

    </div>
    <p>
        As part of the Jira development team in Amsterdam I worked on core product
        features and reliability, and helped explore how AI could make teams faster.
        I built an early prototype of an AI-powered assignee suggestion system that
        analysed issue history, team structure and workload to recommend the most
        suitable person for a new ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
        The work combined Jira’s existing workflows with lightweight machine learning
        models and careful UX so that suggestions felt helpful rather than intrusive,
        and always kept humans in control of the final decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tech:</strong> Java, Jira platform APIs, internal data services,
        ML experimentation (Python), collaborative product design with PMs and designers.

<!-- ERP systems -->
<section>
    <div class="project-header">
        <h3>ERP and Operations Platforms – Bizboard, Sunvigo, SpotmyEnergy and more</h3>
        <div class="project-thumb">
            <img class="theme-light" src="{{ '/assets/img/portfolio/amazon-web-services.webp' | relative_url }}" alt="AWS infrastructure illustration (light)">

        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        For several companies in the Netherlands and Germany I’ve helped design and build
        ERP-style systems that tie together sales, operations, billing and technical data.
        The goal in each case was the same: fewer manual steps, less copy-pasting and more
        reliable, traceable processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        This has included extending existing systems and building new services around them,
        integrating data from CRMs, energy devices and external partners, and giving teams
        simple tools that reflect how they actually work.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tech:</strong> Python (including Odoo), TypeScript, PostgreSQL, data pipelines,
        REST APIs, containerised services (Docker/Kubernetes).

        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Built a new website for BiciCare, a bicycle repair and rental shop in Amsterdam, giving customers a simple way to
        book bikes and services online.
    </p>
    <p>
        Connected the booqable booking platform with their accounting system (Reeleezee) to automate invoicing and keep
        rentals and accounting in sync, cutting manual work for the team. The automation runs in GitHub Actions with
        Python.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tech:</strong> booqable, custom booking flows, API automation with Reeleezee, Python, GitHub Actions.

<!-- Native mobile apps -->
<section>
  <div class="project-header">
    <h3>Android &amp; iOS Mobile Apps for Dutch Companies</h3>
    <div class="project-thumb">
      <img src="/assets/img/portfolio/android.webp" alt="Android app preview">
      <img src="/assets/img/portfolio/ios.png" alt="iOS app preview">
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Built and maintained mobile apps for different companies, covering both native Android/iOS and cross-platform
    setups. The work focused on reliable, polished user experiences and solid integrations with back-end services.
  </p>

  <p>
    On native projects, I worked day-to-day in <strong>Swift</strong> (iOS) and <strong>Kotlin</strong> (Android),
    using modern platform tooling to ship features, fix bugs, and keep performance and UX tight.
    For cross-platform delivery, I used <strong>React Native</strong> and <strong>Flutter</strong> when sharing
    UI/business logic across platforms made sense—while still adapting platform-specific pieces (navigation,
    device APIs, release workflows) where needed.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also contributed to front-end and integration layers around the apps: building and consuming
    <strong>REST/JSON APIs</strong>, implementing <strong>authentication flows</strong>, and aligning mobile
    releases with <strong>Node.js</strong>-based services and existing client systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Earlier projects included <strong>Java</strong> (Android) and <strong>Objective-C</strong> (iOS), which helped
    with maintaining legacy codebases and migrating screens/features to modern approaches without disrupting users.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Tech:</strong> Swift (iOS), Kotlin (Android), Java (Android legacy), Objective-C (iOS legacy),
    React Native, Flutter, REST/JSON APIs, OAuth 2.0 authentication (tokens/refresh flows), Node.js integrations, App Store / Play Store delivery (signing, builds, releases).

<!-- Sunvigo multi-platform app -->

        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        At Sunvigo I worked on a multi-platform mobile application that lets customers
        monitor their solar production and household consumption in real time, view their
        history and adjust key settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal was to make renewable energy usage feel transparent and approachable:
        clear graphs, simple controls and a robust backend that stayed responsive even
        with many customers online.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tech:</strong> Flutter, Quarkus, REST APIs, authentication, monitoring and logging.

<!-- Low-resource language speech model -->

        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Together with colleagues from VU Amsterdam and partner organisations I built and
        evaluated an AI system that can learn a language word-by-word from native speakers,
        even when only a small number of speech samples are available.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a proof of concept we supported Twi (Ghana) and Bambara (Mali), showing that
        communities don’t need massive datasets to start building useful speech technology
        in their own language.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tech:</strong> Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, speech processing, data collection tooling,
        evaluation pipelines.

<!-- Medical imaging AI -->

        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        In collaboration with VU Amsterdam and VUmc I contributed to machine learning
        pipelines that analyse medical images such as MRI, CT and X-ray scans and flag
        cases that may deserve extra attention from clinicians.
    </p>
    <p>
        The focus was not to replace radiologists, but to prioritise suspicious cases,
        reduce the chance of missed findings and support over-stretched hospital teams
        with consistent, explainable signals.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tech:</strong> Python, deep learning frameworks, image preprocessing,
        training and evaluation workflows, clinical collaboration.

<!-- Company LLM / RAG assistants -->
<section>
    <h3>Company Knowledge Assistants (RAG-based LLM Systems)</h3>
    <p>
        For several companies in the Netherlands and the United States I designed and implemented
        “company LLMs” – internal assistants that understand their documentation, processes and
        historical data. These tools help teams find answers faster, draft content, and navigate
        complex internal knowledge bases without having to know exactly where things are stored.
    </p>
    <p>
        The systems use retrieval-augmented generation: relevant documents are retrieved from a
        vector index and passed to an LLM, so answers stay grounded in the company’s own data.
        Depending on the client, the model is either a hosted API (e.g. OpenAI / Anthropic) or a
        self-hosted open-source model such as Llama 3.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tech:</strong> Python (FastAPI/Flask), hosted and self-hosted LLMs (e.g. Llama 3 via
        vLLM / text-generation-inference), SentenceTransformers embeddings, vector databases
        (Qdrant, Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma), S3-compatible storage, Docker-based deployment, and
        simple React/Next.js front-ends with company SSO (OAuth/OIDC) for internal access.

<!-- Jira / Atlassian -->
<section>
    <h3>Jira Issue Assignment Intelligence – Atlassian</h3>
    <p>
        As part of the Jira development team in Amsterdam I worked on core product
        features and reliability, and helped explore how AI could make teams faster.
        I built an early prototype of an AI-powered assignee suggestion system that
        analysed issue history, team structure and workload to recommend the most
        suitable person for a new ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
        The work combined Jira’s existing workflows with lightweight machine learning
        models and careful UX so that suggestions felt helpful rather than intrusive,
        and always kept humans in control of the final decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tech:</strong> Java, Jira platform APIs, internal data services,
        ML experimentation (Python), collaborative product design with PMs and designers.
    </p>

<!-- ERP systems -->
<section>
    <h3>ERP and Operations Platforms – Bizboard, Sunvigo, SpotmyEnergy</h3>
    <p>
        For several companies in the Netherlands and Germany I’ve helped design and build
        ERP-style systems that tie together sales, operations, billing and technical data.
        The goal in each case was the same: fewer manual steps, less copy-pasting and more
        reliable, traceable processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        This has included extending existing systems and building new services around them,
        integrating data from CRMs, energy devices and external partners, and giving teams
        simple tools that reflect how they actually work.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tech:</strong> Python (including Odoo), TypeScript, PostgreSQL, data pipelines,
        REST APIs, containerised services (Docker/Kubernetes).
    </p>

<!-- BiciCare website and automation -->
<section>
    <h3>BiciCare Amsterdam – Rentals & Repairs</h3>
    <p>
        Built a new website for BiciCare, a bicycle repair and rental shop in Amsterdam, giving customers a simple way to
        book bikes and services online.
    </p>
    <p>
        Connected the booqable booking platform with their accounting system (Reeleezee) to automate invoicing and keep
        rentals and accounting in sync, cutting manual work for the team. The automation runs in GitHub Actions with
        Python.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tech:</strong> booqable, custom booking flows, API automation with Reeleezee, Python, GitHub Actions.

<!-- Native mobile apps -->
<section>
    <h3>Native Mobile Apps for Dutch Companies</h3>
    <p>
        Over the years I have built and maintained native Android and iOS applications
        for several companies in the Netherlands, ranging from small tools to more complex,
        data-driven apps. The focus has always been fast, smooth experiences and clean
        integration with back-end services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Early work involved Java and Objective-C, later moving to Swift and modern Android
        tooling. In all cases the apps were closely aligned with the client’s workflows and
        branding rather than generic templates.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tech:</strong> Java (Android), Objective-C, Swift, REST/JSON APIs,
        authentication flows, app store delivery.
    </p>

<!-- Sunvigo multi-platform app -->
<section>
    <h3>Solar Monitoring App – Sunvigo GmbH</h3>
    <p>
        At Sunvigo I worked on a multi-platform mobile application that lets customers
        monitor their solar production and household consumption in real time, view their
        history and adjust key settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal was to make renewable energy usage feel transparent and approachable:
        clear graphs, simple controls and a robust backend that stayed responsive even
        with many customers online.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tech:</strong> Flutter, Quarkus, REST APIs, authentication, monitoring and logging.

<!-- Low-resource language speech model -->
<section>
    <h3>Speech Models for Low-Resource Languages</h3>
    <p>
        Together with colleagues from VU Amsterdam and partner organisations I built and
        evaluated an AI system that can learn a language word-by-word from native speakers,
        even when only a small number of speech samples are available.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a proof of concept we supported Twi (Ghana) and Bambara (Mali), showing that
        communities don’t need massive datasets to start building useful speech technology
        in their own language.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tech:</strong> Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, speech processing, data collection tooling,
        evaluation pipelines.

<!-- Medical imaging AI -->
<section>
    <h3>Medical Imaging Triage Models – VUmc Amsterdam</h3>
    <p>
        In collaboration with VU Amsterdam and VUmc I contributed to machine learning
        pipelines that analyse medical images such as MRI, CT and X-ray scans and flag
        cases that may deserve extra attention from clinicians.
    </p>
    <p>
        The focus was not to replace radiologists, but to prioritise suspicious cases,
        reduce the chance of missed findings and support over-stretched hospital teams
        with consistent, explainable signals.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tech:</strong> Python, deep learning frameworks, image preprocessing,
        training and evaluation workflows, clinical collaboration.

<!-- Coaching website -->
<section>
    <h3>Psychological Coaching Website – Leonie Wittkamp</h3>
    <p>
        Designed and implemented a calm, welcoming brochure site for a psychological coach,
        focusing on clear structure, warm visuals and a frictionless contact flow for
        potential clients.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tech:</strong> Jekyll on GitHub Pages, vanilla HTML, custom responsive CSS.

<!-- Author website -->
<section>
    <h3>Author Website – “Solange wir uns hatten”</h3>
    <p>
        Built an author site for Leonie’s historical novel, with book presentation, events,
        contact and a subtle dark-gold visual theme inspired by the Orient Express motif
        in the story.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tech:</strong> HTML, Bootstrap 5, custom CSS, GitHub Pages.

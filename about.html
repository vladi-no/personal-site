    <p>
        I love wandering through different parts of the world, sharing meals with people I meet, and
        collecting stories from different cultures. I cook recipes I pick up on my travels because they bring me back to
        those warm moments we had together.

    <h3>Life on the road 🚐</h3>
    <p>
        I built a custom campervan named <strong>Chihli</strong> with a wooden interior and solar setup. We’ve traveled
        over 150,000 km together. She’s cozy, reliable, and my little moving cabin for long trips and quiet campsites.

    <h3>Languages & learning 🌐</h3>
    <p>
        I love learning languages because each one opens a new window into how people think. Right now I’m polishing my
        French after spending a few months in France.

    <h3>What I believe 😌</h3>
    <p>
        I believe most people have a good heart. When I travel, I try to give back to the communities that welcome me,
        whether through time, skills, or simply caring for the places that took care of me and showed me their beauty.

    <h3>How I work 🧭</h3>
    <p>
        I work well solo and within teams; many of my current and former colleagues have become lifelong friends. I
        value
        honesty, realistic timelines, and keeping promises modest but solid. I’m most motivated by work that supports
        communities, nature conservation, and human rights.
    </p>
    <p>
        When facing new challenges, I like to slow down, break the problem into parts, and test assumptions carefully.
        Simple, predictable steps are better than rushed, superficial solutions. Iterate, learn, and keep the work
        environment healthy for everyone involved.

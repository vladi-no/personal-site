      <h2>1) Components</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Playing cards:</strong> 2 standard 52-card decks (or 1 deck for smaller groups — see Setup)</li>
        <li><strong>Two</strong> six-sided dice</li>
        <li>Coins for the pot (nickels, dimes, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="setup" class="section">
      <h2>2) Setup</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Deck count:</strong> Use <strong>two decks</strong> for <strong>5–6 players</strong>. For <strong>fewer than 5 players</strong>, use <strong>one deck</strong>.</li>

        <li><strong>Coin buy-in (typical):</strong> Before the game starts, the group agrees on a starting amount of coins. Everyone starts with the <strong>same</strong> amount.</li>
        <li><strong>Elimination (typical):</strong> If a player runs out of coins at any time, they are <strong>out of the game</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional mode:</strong> You can also play with <strong>infinite coins</strong> so nobody can be eliminated for running out.</li>

        <li>Combine the deck(s) you are using into one stack.</li>
        <li>Remove <strong>all Kings</strong>, <strong>all Sevens</strong>, and <strong>all Aces</strong>.</li>
        <li>Shuffle the remaining cards well.</li>
        <li>Deal all remaining cards as evenly as possible among players.</li>
        <li>
          Each player lays their cards <strong>face-up</strong> in front of them.
          Everyone is allowed to see everyone’s cards at all times.
        </li>
        <li>Put a space/pile in the middle for the <strong>pot</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Starting pot ante:</strong> Before the game begins, every player puts <strong>one dime (10¢)</strong> into the pot.</li>
      </ol>

      <aside class="callout">
        <h3>Card Values Used in This Game</h3>
        <p>
          During play, number cards represent their face value. Face cards have special meaning:
          <strong>Jack = 11</strong> and <strong>Queen = 12</strong> for matching dice rolls.
        </p>
        <p>
          For <strong>end-of-game scoring only</strong>, <strong>Jacks</strong> and <strong>Queens</strong> are worth <strong>10¢</strong> each.
        </p>
      </aside>
    </section>

    <section id="start-player" class="section">
      <h2>3) Starting Player</h2>
      <p>
        Each player looks only at their own face-up cards and identifies the best poker hand they can make
        from those cards (typical poker ranking).
      </p>
      <p>
        The player with the <strong>best poker hand</strong> starts the game.
        If there’s a tie, the tied players can pick a simple tiebreaker (e.g., compare highest card)
        or just agree on who goes first.
      </p>
      <p class="emph">
        Before rolling the dice for the first time, the starting player takes all the dimes from the pot.
      </p>

      <h2>4) How Turns Work</h2>

      <div class="ruleblock">
        <h3>On your turn:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Roll the two dice and add them together.</li>
          <li>
            If you can “cover” the roll, you flip card(s) face-down and <strong>keep rolling</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you cannot cover the roll, your turn ends (see the next section).
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <aside class="callout">
        <h3>Face cards as natural matches</h3>
        <p>
          During play, <strong>Jacks</strong> are treated as <strong>11</strong> and
          <strong>Queens</strong> are treated as <strong>12</strong> when matching dice rolls.
        </p>
        <p>
          This applies anywhere a <em>natural</em> match is allowed, including when other players
          flip cards after someone cannot cover a roll.
        </p>
      </aside>

      <h3>4.1 Natural match</h3>
      <p>
        If the total you rolled matches a card you have <strong>exactly</strong>
        (example: roll <strong>5</strong> and you have a <strong>5</strong>; roll <strong>11</strong> and you have a <strong>Jack</strong>;
        roll <strong>12</strong> and you have a <strong>Queen</strong>), that is a <strong>natural</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="emph">
        Flip that matching card face-down.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 Two-card combination</h3>
      <p>
        If you do <strong>not</strong> have the natural card for the roll, you may flip
        a <strong>maximum of two</strong> cards that add up to the rolled total.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Example: roll <strong>8</strong> → flip <strong>5 + 3</strong> (two cards).</li>
        <li>You may not use three (or more) cards to make a total.</li>
      </ul>

      <aside class="callout subtle">
        <h3>Important</h3>
        <p>
          On your own turn, you may cover a roll either with a <strong>natural</strong> (one card)
          or with a <strong>two-card combo</strong>—as long as you have the cards available.
        </p>
      </aside>
    </section>

    <section id="cant-match" class="section">
      <h2>5) When You Can’t Match a Roll</h2>
      <p>
        If you roll a total and you have <strong>no natural</strong> for that number and
        <strong>no valid two-card combination</strong> that equals that number, then:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Your turn ends immediately.</strong></li>
        <li>
          Any other player(s) who have the <strong>natural</strong> card for the number you rolled
          may flip that card face-down.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <aside class="callout">
        <h3>Natural-only rule on “steal flips”</h3>
        <p>
          When other players flip cards because <em>you</em> couldn’t cover a roll, they may flip
          <strong>only the natural single card</strong> (including Jack for 11 and Queen for 12).
          <br />
          They may <strong>not</strong> use combinations in this situation.

      <h2>6) The Seven Rule (Pot Building)</h2>
      <p>
        Even though all <strong>7 cards</strong> were removed from the deck, rolling a <strong>7</strong>
        on the dice triggers payments into the pot.
      </p>

      <div class="ruleblock">
        <h3>Whenever you roll a 7 on your turn:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>All other players (everyone except the roller) pay into the pot.</li>
          <li>The amount depends on how many 7s you have rolled <strong>during this same turn</strong>.</li>
          <li>Each additional 7 rolled during the same turn increases the amount by 5¢.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <table class="rules-table" aria-label="Seven pot escalation table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th># of 7s rolled this turn</th>
            <th>Each other player pays</th>

        </tbody>
      </table>

      <aside class="callout subtle">
        <h3>Not consecutive</h3>
        <p>
          The 7s do <strong>not</strong> need to be rolled back-to-back.
          Example: If you roll 7 (5¢), then later roll 8 and flip it, then later roll 7 again,
          the second 7 still increases to <strong>10¢</strong> (because it’s the 2nd seven of that turn).

    <section id="end-game" class="section">
      <h2>7) Ending & Payout</h2>

      <h3>7.1 How the game ends</h3>
      <p class="emph">
        The game ends immediately when a player flips <strong>all</strong> their cards face-down.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no “fewest cards” ending condition. Someone must fully clear their layout to win.
      </p>

      <h3>7.2 Winner collects the pot</h3>
      <p>
        The winner takes all the money that accumulated in the center pot from the Seven Rule and final payments.
      </p>

      <h3>7.3 Final payments based on remaining cards</h3>
      <p>
        After the winner clears all their cards, every other player totals the value of the cards they still
        have face-up:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Jack</strong> = 10¢ (end-of-game scoring only)</li>
        <li><strong>Queen</strong> = 10¢ (end-of-game scoring only)</li>
        <li>Number cards = their face value (10=10¢, 9=9¢, 8=8¢, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Add the values, then <strong>round down to the nearest 5¢</strong> (nearest nickel).
        Pay that many cents to the winner.
      </p>

      <aside class="callout">
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>
          If your remaining cards total <strong>42</strong>, round down to <strong>40</strong> → you pay
          <strong>40¢</strong>.
        </p>
      </aside>
    </section>

    <section id="examples" class="section">
      <h2>8) Examples</h2>

      <div class="example">
        <h3>Example A: Natural vs combo</h3>
        <p>You roll a total of <strong>8</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you have an <strong>8</strong> card, flip the 8 (natural).</li>
          <li>If you don’t have an 8, but you have <strong>5</strong> and <strong>3</strong>, flip both (combo).</li>
          <li>You may not use 2+2+4 (three cards). Max is two cards.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <h3>Example B: “Can’t match” ends turn + other players flip naturals</h3>
        <p>
          You roll <strong>8</strong> but you have no 8 card and no two-card combo that makes 8.
          Your turn ends immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any other player(s) who have a natural <strong>8</strong> may flip their 8 face-down.
          They may not flip 5+3 for this bonus—only the natural 8.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <h3>Example C: Seven escalation during a turn</h3>
        <p>During your turn you roll:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>7</strong> → every other player pays <strong>5¢</strong></li>
          <li><strong>8</strong> (you can cover it) → you flip your card(s) and keep rolling</li>
          <li><strong>7</strong> again → every other player now pays <strong>10¢</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The 7s didn’t have to be consecutive. The second 7 still increases the payment.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="notes" class="section">
      <h2>9) Notes & Clarifications</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This ruleset assumes you continue rolling on your turn as long as you successfully flip card(s)
          for each roll.
        </li>
        <li>
          Because 7s are removed from the deck, <strong>rolling 7</strong> is purely a pot mechanic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Coin rules can be played either as elimination (typical) or infinite coins (no elimination).
          Choose as a group before starting.
        </li>
        <li>
          The starting player takes the initial dime antes before the first roll; after that, the pot is primarily built
          by the Seven Rule and final payments.
        </li>
      </ul>
